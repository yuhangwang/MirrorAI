Symmetry Detection Competition - REFLECTION

July 5, 2011

The provided groundtruth files follow the following format (notice this format differs from that given for the training image set):

[X1 Y1 X2 Y2]

Each reflection axis is encoded as a line with start and end points given by P1=(X1,Y1) and P2=(X2,Y2)

Other symmetry descriptors are not included here, as they were not used in the competition (e.g. number of folds, type of symmetry, etc.)
